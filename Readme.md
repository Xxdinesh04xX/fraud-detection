# Fraud Detection with Machine Learning On Banksim Data

Fraudulent behavior can be seen across many different fields such as e-commerce, healthcare, payment and banking systems. Fraud costs businesses millions of dollars each year. 

Automated detection of fraudulent behavior can be done in various ways including rule based approaches and machine learning.
This repository uses the latter approach for classification of fraudulent transactions. The synthetically generated dataset consists of payments from various customers made in different time periods and with different amounts. If you want more information on the dataset you can refer below to the Dataset title for the dataset link and information and you can find the original paper for the dataset under the "Original Paper" title. 

For those who do not wish to run the script for acquiring the results, here is a quick recap of the classification results of the machine learning models used in the script:
